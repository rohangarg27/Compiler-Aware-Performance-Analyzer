# Compiler-Aware Code Performance Analyzer

A systems-level performance analysis tool that studies how compiler optimization
flags transform C++ programs at the assembly level and how those transformations
impact execution efficiency.

Unlike traditional benchmarking tools that only measure runtime, this analyzer
correlates **compiler optimization decisions**, **assembly instruction patterns**,
and **instruction-count reduction** to generate actionable performance insights.
